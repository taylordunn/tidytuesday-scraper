# tidytuesday-scraper

A small project to periodically scrape tweets for the [`#TidyTuesday` project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

Currently, new tweets are downloaded every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday (at midnight) using [this GitHub workflow](https://github.com/taylordunn/tidytuesday-scraper/blob/main/.github/workflows/download-tweets.yaml).
